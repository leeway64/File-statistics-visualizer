# File statistics visualizer
This project visualizes and displays several statistics about the types of files inside a given directory.

A bar chart and pie chart are created to show the relative popularity of each file type.

As an added bonus, this project also includes an extra function for printing out every single file and subdirectory within a user-inputted directory.
