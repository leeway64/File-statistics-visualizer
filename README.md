# File statistics visualizer
This project visualizes and displays several statistics about the types of files inside a given directory.

A histogram and pie chart is created for the 10 most popular file types.

As an added bonus, this project also includes an extra function for printing out every single file and subdirectory within a user-inputted directory.
